Travel‐In‐10 ‐ AI‐powered travel recommendation app

This project was created to fulfill the requirements of the Stanford Code In Place 2025 Final project.

Project description:

Finding the perfect destination for your next holiday is hard.

This console app makes it easy by going through a list of targeted questions that feed into an AI bot to give you some suitable options.

The user does not have to answer all questions and all questions will be answered in a random order to give a more unpredictable outcome.

Questions:

What kind of holiday do you prefer? (e.g. beach holiday, city break, off-the-beaten track)
What kind of budget do you have in mind? (e.g. luxury, backpacking)
How long should the journey to your destination be?
How many people do you want to travel with? (i.e. with family or alone)
Where is your nearest airport?
What is your star sign?
What is the craziest thing you've ever done (and enjoyed)? (e.g. sky diving)
What are your favorite cultural activities (or none)?
What are your food preferences or favorite foods?
